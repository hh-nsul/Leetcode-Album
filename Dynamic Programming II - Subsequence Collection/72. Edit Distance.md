### 72. Edit Distance

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`*.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros" **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** 
> horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
> rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
> rose -> ros (remove 'e')

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution" **Output:** 5 **Explanation:** 
> intention -> inention (remove 't')
> inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
> enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
> exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
> exection -> execution (insert 'u')

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
