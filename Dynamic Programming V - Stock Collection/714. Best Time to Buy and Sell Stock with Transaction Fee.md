### 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
> **Output:** 8
> **Explanation:** The maximum profit can be achieved by:
> 
> - Buying at prices[0] = 1
> - Selling at prices[3] = 8
> - Buying at prices[4] = 4
> - Selling at prices[5] = 9
>   The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
> **Output:** 6

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4`



```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {

        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][3];
        dp[0][HELD] = -prices[0];
        
        for (int day = 1; day < prices.length; ++day) {
            
            int yesterday = day - 1;
            
            dp[day][UNHOLD] = Math.max(dp[yesterday][UNHOLD], 
                                       dp[yesterday][HELD] + prices[day] - fee);
            
            dp[day][HELD] = Math.max(dp[yesterday][HELD], 
                                     dp[yesterday][UNHOLD] - prices[day]);
        }
        
        return dp[prices.length - 1][UNHOLD];
    }
    
    private final int UNHOLD = 0;
    private final int HELD = 1;
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        
        int n = prices.length;
        int sell = 0;
        int buy = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            buy = Math.max(buy, sell - prices[i]);
            sell = Math.max(sell, buy + prices[i] - fee);
        }
        
        return sell;
    }
}
```
