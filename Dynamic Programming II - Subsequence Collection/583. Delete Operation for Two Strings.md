### 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of **steps** required to make* `word1` *and* `word2` *the same*.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat" **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco" **Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.
